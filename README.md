# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
- Using different techniques to train and evaulate models to evaluate if a customer has good or bad credit.  Since our dataset is unbalanced we will have to use unbalanced libraries to build and evaluate the models.

## Results
- Bulled list that describes the balance accuracy scores and the precicison and reclass scores of all ML models

### Over and Undersampling to predict Credit Risk
#### Oversampling
##### Naive Random Oversampling
